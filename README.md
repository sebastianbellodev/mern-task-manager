# Node.js API with React Client and MongoDB storage

This repository contains a project that includes a Node.js RESTful API server along with client applications built with React and MongoDB storage.

## Key Features

- **Node.js API Server:** A robust Node.js API server acts as the backend for the client applications. It offers endpoints for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with databases or external services. The server follows best practices for scalability, security, and performance.

- **React:** A React project serves as the client application for the Node.js API. Providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API server. The client application handles tasks like authentication, data retrieval, submission, and more.

- **Database Integration:** The Node.js API server integrates with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data efficiently. The client applications communicate with the API server to interact with the database, supporting operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

- **Authentication and Security:** The API server and client applications employ authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access and protect sensitive data. Users can authenticate themselves using credentials or tokens, and the server enforces proper authorization and validation of API requests.
